### Hi! 👋
I'm an incoming CS student at UCSD. I enjoy learning about a wide variety of subjects. That’s why I love computer science — it’s cool in itself, and also blazes new trails in every other field. 

Here are a few things I’ve used programming for:
* A digital scale for a Science Olympiad competition 🧪
* A “runaway button” robot car that, well, runs when you press it 🚗
* Web development — it started when a friend asked me to work on her mathematics website. Now, I’ve done web development for a school club, a local nonprofit, and a company 📈
* And finally, a Chrome extension that I made to curb my YouTube addiction 😅

I love to share my interests with others. As president of Coding Tomorrow Initiative, I’ve organized and taught beginner coding classes for younger kids. Seeing the projects they build is simply the best!

In college, I’m excited to meld my passions by blending my academic learnings with my experience in tech, leadership, and teaching.
